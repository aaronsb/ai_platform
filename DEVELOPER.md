# Developer Guidelines

This document provides guidelines and best practices for developers working on the AI Platform project.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Git
   - Node.js (latest LTS version)
   - A code editor (VS Code recommended)
   - NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit (for GPU support)

2. **Local Development Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-platform
   ./deploy-ai-platform.sh --confirm
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic

### Shell Scripts

- Use shellcheck for linting
- Add error handling for critical operations
- Use functions for reusable code
- Add logging for important operations
- Include usage documentation
- Make scripts idempotent when possible

### Docker

- Follow Docker best practices
- Use multi-stage builds when applicable
- Minimize image layers
- Use specific version tags for base images
- Include health checks
- Document exposed ports and volumes

## Testing

1. **Local Testing**
   - Test deployment script with different flags
   - Verify container health and logs
   - Check volume persistence
   - Test GPU access where applicable

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test inter-service communication
   - Verify MCP Bridge functionality
   - Test with different MCP servers
   - Validate Watchtower updates

## Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date
- Document all configuration options
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Add inline documentation for complex functions
- Update architecture diagrams when making structural changes

## Git Workflow

1. **Branching**
   - `main` - stable production code
   - `develop` - integration branch
   - `feature/*` - new features
   - `fix/*` - bug fixes
   - `release/*` - release preparation

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - Reference issues where applicable

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Include description of changes
   - Add test results
   - Update documentation
   - Request review from maintainers

## Release Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Update version numbers
   - Update changelog
   - Test all components
   - Update documentation

2. **Release**
   - Tag release in git
   - Update release notes
   - Deploy to staging
   - Verify deployment
   - Deploy to production

## Security

- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow security best practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits

## Performance

- Monitor resource usage
- Optimize container configurations
- Profile code when necessary
- Document performance requirements
- Regular performance testing

## Support

- Join our Discord community
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Provide detailed information when reporting issues
- Help others in the community

Remember to always test your changes thoroughly before submitting them for review.
